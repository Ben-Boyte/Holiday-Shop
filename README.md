Our targeted user is in their early-mid thirties with an eye for unique treasures. They prefer shopping local, but don’t always have to time to wander the shelves looking for special items. “A Curated Christmas” gives them that local, one-of-a-kind shopping experience on a digital platform. 
This is not a site for the casual shopper. This is a place for finding special gifts for very special people.
